I am currently a second-year master student in the MA program of Computational Social Science at `The University of Chicago`. 

Prior to relocating to the United States, I worked with [`Dr. Jia Liu`](https://brain.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1010/1010.htm) at `Tsinghua University` investigating the **visual illusions** of humans using deep neural networks. Subsequently, I had the opportunity to work alongside [`Dr. Ke Zhou`](http://bnupsych.bnu.edu.cn/tabid/324/ArticleID/5045/frtid/307/Default.aspx) and [`Dr. Liqin Zhou`](https://psych.bnu.edu.cn/szdw/zrjs/jsa/zlq/index.htm) at `Beijing Normal University`, focusing on two research areas: **facial expression** representation in deep neural networks and the **attention** mechanisms in humans.
