I am currently a second-year master student in the MA program of Computational Social Science at `The University of Chicago`. I am working with [`Dr. Jai Yu`](https://psychology.uchicago.edu/directory/jai-yu) in the [`Neurophysiology of Experience, Memory and Knowledge Lab`](https://voices.uchicago.edu/jaiyu/). My current interest is to explore in-vivo electrophysiology data with a finer spatial and temporal resolution to gain deeper insights into how the brain orchestrates interactions among various regions to facilitate the acquisition of new knowledge from everyday experiences.

Prior to relocating to the United States, I worked with [`Dr. Jia Liu`](https://brain.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1010/1010.htm) at `Tsinghua University` investigating the **visual illusions** of humans using deep neural networks. Subsequently, I had the opportunity to work alongside [`Dr. Ke Zhou`](http://bnupsych.bnu.edu.cn/tabid/324/ArticleID/5045/frtid/307/Default.aspx) and [`Dr. Liqin Zhou`](https://psych.bnu.edu.cn/szdw/zrjs/jsa/zlq/index.htm) at `Beijing Normal University`, focusing on two research areas: **facial expression** representation in deep neural networks and the **attention** mechanisms in humans.
