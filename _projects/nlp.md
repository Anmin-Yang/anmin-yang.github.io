Psychology has a longstanding belief that the words and content one chooses to express are not random but rather a reflection of the hidden state of one's mental world. The famous **Freudian Slip** suggests that a verbal or memory mistake is believed to reveal an unconscious belief, thought, or motive. The **Thematic Apperception Test (TAT)** follows a similar assumption by analyzing one's thought to an ambiguous or open-end stimuli.

While those methods have deep roots in psychology, they are often accused of **bad inter-rater reliability** and **doubtful validity**. On the other hand, although questionaires are considered the standard of clinical diagnosis, for particular cohorts, in our case, adolescents, the self-report measure may be potentially biased due to factors such as limited language skills, life experiences, cognitive impairments, and the social expectancy bias. This study aims to find more **ecological**, age-appropriate and psychologically appropriate depression detection methods for adolescents.

We used studentsâ€™ compositions written in the classroom to detect depression among adolescents.

For **feature extraction**, we employed both theory-based and data-driven approach:

- LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count)
- Word2Vec

For **classifiers**, we used:

- classic machine learning approach
  - Logistic Regression
  - SVM
- deep neural networks
  - TextCNN
  - TextRNN

The textRNN model achieved the best performance with F-measure at 0.74.

Our research highlights the potential of natural language processing techniques in detecting depressive tendencies in young populations at school.
