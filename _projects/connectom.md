In this study, we developed a **connectome-wise neuromarker** based on **whole-brain functional connectivity (FC)** that can predict an individualâ€™s **number acuity** and **arithmetic skills**.

In the discovery and validation dataset, subjects underwent a classical nonsymbolic number-comparison task(Fig. 1A). The arithmetic skills was evaluated on the HCP dataset with math task(Fig. 1D)

The CPM (connectome-based predictive modeling) could predict individual differences in ANS acuity (Fig. 2).

In addition, the summed FC strength within the numerosity network predicted arithmetic skills specifically(Fig. 3).

The anatomy of the CPM shows more contralateral connections than ipsilateral connections and included many numerosityrelated brain regions reported in previous studies (Fig.4 b).

The connectivity at the macroscale regions shows different patterns (Fig. 5). For instance, the PFC nodes were mainly connected within the lobes while the occipital (primary visual and visual association) nodes were mostly connected to parietal and motor regions.
