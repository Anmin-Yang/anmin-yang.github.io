  abstract={Recent studies found that the deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) trained to recognize facial identities
spontaneously learned features that support facial expression recognition, and vice versa. Here, we showed that
the self-emerged expression-selective units in a VGG-Face trained for facial identification were tuned to distinct
basic expressions and, importantly, exhibited hallmarks of human expression recognition (i.e., facial expression
confusion and categorical perception). We then investigated whether the emergence of expression-selective units
is attributed to either face-specific experience or domain-general processing by conducting the same analysis on
a VGG-16 trained for object classification and an untrained VGG-Face without any visual experience, both having
the identical architecture with the pretrained VGG-Face. Although similar expression-selective units were found
in both DCNNs, they did not exhibit reliable human-like characteristics of facial expression perception. Together,
these findings revealed the necessity of domain-specific visual experience of face identity for the development
of facial expression perception, highlighting the contribution of nurture to form human-like facial expression perception.},
